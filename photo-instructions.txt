# Adding Your Baby Photos to the Gallery

Follow these steps to replace the placeholder images with your actual baby photos:

## Option 1: Simplest Method (Recommended)

1. Create a folder called "photos" in the same directory as the index.html file
2. Add your baby photos to this folder
3. Rename your photos to follow a simple numbering pattern, like:
   - photo1.jpg
   - photo2.jpg
   - photo3.jpg
   - ... and so on
4. Open the script.js file in a text editor
5. Find the imageData array (near the top of the file)
6. Replace the placeholder URLs with your photo filenames:

```javascript
const imageData = [
    {
        src: 'photos/photo1.jpg',
        caption: 'Welcome to the world, little angel!'
    },
    {
        src: 'photos/photo2.jpg',
        caption: 'First family photo'
    },
    // Continue for all your photos
];
```

7. Edit the caption text for each photo to describe the moment

## Option 2: Using Online Images

If you already have your baby photos stored online (like Google Photos, Flickr, or other photo hosting):

1. Get the direct URL to each photo (usually by right-clicking on the photo and selecting "Copy Image Address")
2. Open the script.js file in a text editor
3. Find the imageData array (near the top of the file) 
4. Replace the placeholder URLs with your direct photo URLs:

```javascript
const imageData = [
    {
        src: 'https://your-photo-hosting.com/direct-link-to-photo1.jpg',
        caption: 'Welcome to the world, little angel!'
    },
    // Continue for all your photos
];
```

## Photo Preparation Tips

For best results:
- Use photos with similar dimensions (ideally landscape orientation)
- Optimize your photos for web (compress them to reduce file size)
- Aim for a file size of 200KB-1MB per photo
- Common formats that work well: JPG, PNG, WEBP
- Consider using a free tool like TinyPNG.com to optimize your images

## Adding Many Photos

If you have many photos (20+), consider:
1. Adding them in batches
2. Testing the gallery after each batch to ensure it loads properly
3. Further compressing images to maintain fast loading times

## Changing the Slideshow Timing

By default, each photo displays for 4 seconds. To change this:
1. Open script.js
2. Find the line: `const animationDelay = 4000;`
3. Change 4000 to your preferred time in milliseconds (1000 = 1 second)

Enjoy your personalized baby photo gallery!
